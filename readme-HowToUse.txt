since latest python update it now creates virtual environments and you can check that with the .venv file, i created a requirements.txt file to help u install needed packages
just paste the following in your local terminal (inside VScode, or PyCharm or wahatever ide, BUT NOT windows Terminal):

pip install -r requirements.txt
